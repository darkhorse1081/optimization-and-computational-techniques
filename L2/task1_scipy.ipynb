    "- ***Syntax*** - we have *very* precise expectations about how you write computer code. If you type an opening bracket, `(`, you must close it again later, `)`. Some control structures are terminated by a colon, `:` - if you omit this, the code will not work. ***Yes, learning syntax for a new code is very pedantic and a total pain.*** But you have to do it anyway, and at least Python returns readable error messages to help you understand your missteps...\n",

    "Some Python conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Commenting*** - it is helpful for the poor soul who has to read your poorly written Python (sometimes that is you, weeks or months later) if you have included little **'sign-posts'** in the code, articulating what you are doing. These are called comments. They begin with a `#` symbol, after which you can write whatever you like and it will not be executed as a command.\n",
    "- ***Sensible variable names*** - relating to the thing the variable represents but not too long. For example, if a variable contains the mean temperature, then `Tmean` is a sensible variable name, where as `the_mean_temperature_of_the_profile` or `a1` are not sensible variable names.\n",

    "2. The second line creates a **variable** called `hello_string` and **assigns to it** the ***value*** `'Hello, world'`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ***line*** - just as you read a book one sentence at a time, Python executes a computer program one line at a time. If Python is executing the 4th line of a program, it *will* have knowledge of the three lines preceding it, *but no* knowledge of the lines that follow.\n",
    "- ***variable*** - think of this as a 'container' inside the computer code. A variable has a **name** (in this case, `hello_string`) and a **value**.\n",
    "- ***value*** - the thing sitting inside the 'container', in this case it is `'Hello, world'`, which is a particular **type** of variable called a string.\n",
    "- ***type*** - a classification of the variable, e.g., `'hi'` and `'Hello, world'` are both *strings*, `3.2`, `5.0` and `-0.12e5` are *floats*, and `2`, `-3412` and `0` are *integers*. There are other types, we will get to some of them later.\n",
    "- ***assign to*** - the act of giving a *value* to a *variable*, usually accomplished by an 'equals sign', e.g., `variable = value`.\n",
    "- ***function*** - a sequence of Python commands, written down somewhere else, to achieve some small (or large) task. Some functions are given to you as part of Python and its modules. Others you will have to define yourself. Functions inputs are given inside of **round brackets**.\n",
    "- ***input/argument*** - a variable that is used by a function as it executes its tasks."
