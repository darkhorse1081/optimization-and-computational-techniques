# Optimization-and-computational-techniques

This repository contains materials and solutions for exploring key concepts in computer architecture and computational methods, with a focus on applications in engineering. Topics include data representation, memory architecture, hardware interfacing, and the limitations inherent to computational systems.

Throughout the modules and problems - we dive into

Numerical computation, algorithm design, and Python coding paradigms
Core algorithms in data management (I/O operations, linked lists, and file systems)
Efficient sorting, searching, and network algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm)
Advanced techniques for managing floating point errors and implementing LU factorization
Numerical interpolation (polynomial fitting, splines) and integration methods
Solving ODEs and analyzing algorithm convergence, accuracy, and stability
Code profiling, Big O analysis, and parallelization strategies for performance enhancement
Software quality practices, including unit testing, version control, and error handling
